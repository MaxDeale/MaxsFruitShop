
- data persistence is a problem with local storage so far, as i need to get the cart row from the cart page, and add fruits from he fruit page, etc...

- getting NaN for total and undefined for name and price on the first time add to cart is clicked.

-as a result of this i cannot add the current fruit price to the total when adding to cart

-the remove function is returning null for the price element for some reason.
